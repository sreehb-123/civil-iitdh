                The <strong>Department of Civil and Infrastructure Engineering</strong> at IIT Dharwad is steadily growing into a hub of innovation, sustainability, and advanced research. With a strong focus on addressing real-world infrastructure challenges, our faculty and students are engaged in impactful research across structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, water resource engineering, and transportation engineering.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a young and evolving department, we are committed to nurturing talent and building a globally competitive academic and research environment. For funding, we depend on competitive grants from government and private agencies, which often fall short in meeting the broader needs of our students and scholars, especially in areas such as travel for presenting research at international conferences, procuring specialized equipment, and supporting day-to-day research contingencies.
            </p>

            <p>
                To bridge this gap, we invite generous contributions from individuals, alumni, and organizations who believe in the power of education and research to shape a better future. Your support will directly enhance our students' academic and professional journeys and strengthen our capacity for high-impact research.
            </p>
